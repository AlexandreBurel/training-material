## What went right

- Everything in the training proceeded smoothly, no major issues with users following directions
- Infrastructure functioned without problem
- Users enjoyed finding out about the scratchbook

## What went wrong

- The computers in our pool were in German, so some of the users had trouble finding certain right-click actions. We have made a note internally that instructors need to clarify this for users.
- Renaming history requires you to hit 'enter' when you're done which isn't currently mentioned in the instructions.
