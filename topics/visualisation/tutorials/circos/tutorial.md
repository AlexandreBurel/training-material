# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

e have identified several Circos plots which cover a wide gamut of possibilities; from more artistic renderings of data, to converted Circster plots, to reproducing plots that are output by unconfigurable, purpose specific circos wrappers.

In this tutorial we will show you how to reproduce these plots and hopefully you can draw inspiration from these for developing your own plots.

# Circos is an Iterative Process

Publication quality circos plots are *rarely* produced on the first try. Developing a quality Circos plot involves a lot of trial and error to find the best way to convey specific pieces of your data to your audience.

![Gif of a circos plots through the development process](../../images/circos.gif "Circos plots are an iterative process, requiring many iterative steps, each improving your plot and getting you closer to a final image.")

And while the Circos tool covers a huge range of scenarios, it does not support every option. When you've created the best possible plot, you will likely be only 90% of the way to a true, production-quality plot. As a result, the Circos tool lets you download the configuration files it uses, and you can immediately continue from where you were in Galaxy.

# Nature Cover ENCODE Diagram

Here we will reproduce the output of the [Circos tutorial](http://circos.ca/documentation/tutorials/recipes/nature_cover_encode/lesson) for producing an image like that which was used on Nature's Cover:

![Nature Cover ENCODE](../../images/nature_cover_encode.png "Nature Cover")

The official Circos tutorial goes into detail on how to use rules and variables and automagic counting to help automate the production of such an image.

```
<plot>
r1   = dims(ideogram,radius_inner)
         - conf(plot_padding)*eval(remap(counter(plot),0,conf(num_plots),1,0.9))
         - eval((conf(plot_width)+conf(plot_padding))*counter(plot)*eval(remap(counter(plot),0,conf(num_plots),1,0.9)))
r0   = conf(.,r1)
         - conf(plot_width)*eval(remap(counter(plot),0,conf(num_plots),1,0.9))
post_increment_counter = plot:1
<<include rules.conf>>
</plot>
```

Due to the Circos Galaxy tool being a simplified interface and more user-friendly interface, we cannot make use of these advanced features like using Perl's math or `eval`uating code snippets to generate our image. <!-- TODO(hxr): fix the wording, this is gross -->

## Data Formats

<!-- TODO(hxr): document it all -->

The Circos Galaxy tool mostly accepts `tabular` files. These always have at least three columns:

1. Chromosome
2. Start
3. End

## Get data
